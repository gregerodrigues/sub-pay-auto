```

Library used to interact with the `PoolManager` to settle any open deltas.
To settle a positive delta (a credit to the user), a user may take or mint.
To settle a negative delta (a debt on the user), a user may transfer or burn to pay off a debt.

Based on the https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/blob/main/test/utils/CurrencySettler.sol[Uniswap v4 test utils implementation].

NOTE: Deltas are synced before any ERC-20 transfers in {settle} function.
